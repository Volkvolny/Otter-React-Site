# Otter-React-Site

Welcome to my first ever React.js site, Otterpedia. To stretch my recent React.js learning and knowledge, I created a whole site around one of my favourite little animals; the otter. This site is decked out with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js and includes 4 pages, different types of formatting on each page as well as a collapsable Navbar. The site is mostly mobile-friendly, with a few minor kinks still to address, but it's a great representation of what I can do/design.

For a full site preview, please see the link or click the imbedded video below:
